    <h2>Orlando: The Queer Element</h2>

      In 2017, the film was screened numerous times as part of a multi-media arts project Orlando: The Queer Element. The project explored issues of science and gender through history and was organised by the theatre company Clay & Diamonds, in association with organisations such as The BFI and The National Trust, with funding from the Wellcome Trust and Arts Council England.
      </p><p>
      A one off immersive performance, using five actors (with some from the LGBT community), took place on Friday 24 March at the BFI Flare: London LGBT Film Festival, alongside a 25th Anniversary screening of the film.
      </p><p>
      A separate series of performances were mounted in June by Clay & Diamonds with over thirty actors from the performance training company Fourth Monkey. Together they created a site-specific piece that was performed at the National Trust venues Hanbury Hall and Knole House (the home of Virginia Woolfâ€™s lover, and inspiration for Orlando, Vita Sackville West). These performances were made for both the general public and school audiences, with many of the performances featuring a live screening of the film. The event also served part of The National Trust's Prejudice and Pride programme, which marked 50 years since the partial decriminalisation of homosexuality in the United Kingdom with the Sexual Offences Act 1967.
      </p><p>
      The project also featured the screening of a number of short art films created by Masters in Design students at the Royal College of Art, as well as a series of scientific workshops and lectures.
